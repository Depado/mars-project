# Mars Project : Year-End Project #
### Main Goal of the Project ###
The main goal of this project is to use the data grabbed by the satellites around the Mars Planet to create a 3D representation of it.  

The representation of the Mars Planet, in the end, will just be a sample of what could be done with our program. In the end the program should be able to open .cub, .dem and such files and create a representation in 3 Dimensions of these data.
